👋 Hello, World! I'm Poornav G 👨‍💻
Hey there! I'm Poornav G, a student of Information Science with a passion for web development, pentesting, cybersecurity, and cryptography. I love exploring the tech world with tools like Burpsuite, Nmap, Cisco Packet Tracer, and Wireshark. When I'm not coding or unraveling the mysteries of the digital realm, you can find me watching anime, playing football, or enjoying the hilarious antics of the Sidemen. Every bug is just a feature waiting to be discovered!
